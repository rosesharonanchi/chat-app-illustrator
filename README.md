### What I learned

- I learned that you can add multiple background images and style them seperately.
```html
<div class="body-image"></div>
```
```css
.body-image{
    background-image: url(assets/background-image.png), url(assets/Rectangle\ 244.png);
   background-size: 30% 90dvh, 25% 100dvh;
   background-repeat: no-repeat;
   background-position: -5% -10%, 100% -100%;
  height: 90dvb;  
  
}
```


### Useful resources
